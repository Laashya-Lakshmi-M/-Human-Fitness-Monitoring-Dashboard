# 🧍 Human Fitness Monitoring Dashboard
**Real-time fitness tracking using MATLAB Mobile & ThingSpeak**

🏆 **Best MATLAB Usage Award**  
Awarded during *“MATLAB for AI, Data Analytics, and IoT”* workshop series.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
With the rise of wearable and mobile health monitoring, there is a need for a **simple, low-cost system** to track basic fitness parameters like motion activity and step count using commonly available devices.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design a **real-time human fitness monitoring system** that:
- Collects motion sensor data from a smartphone
- Estimates step count using signal processing
- Visualizes data on a cloud-based IoT dashboard

---

## 🧠 System Workflow
1. Smartphone sensors collect motion data using MATLAB Mobile  
2. Data is processed in MATLAB (filtering & step detection)  
3. Extracted features are uploaded to ThingSpeak  
4. Live visualization is displayed on a cloud dashboard
